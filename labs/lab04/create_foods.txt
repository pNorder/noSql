7-3-1: The row key should be the food code
7-3-2: Column Family Options
BloomFilter: since all food data columns are present, just the row makes sense
Versions: Versioning might make sense if the data includes brand name items. this way
it would be possible to track food content changes across time for one product
Compression: since there is not large amounts of text, compression will not make any huge improvements

7-3-3:
create 'foods', 'facts'
 

For options, I used the ones I described above
